**You don't need to be concerned about the responsiveness of the application or to be accurate with the colors and fonts.** The main goal is to create the components and pages.

1. Header:

- The icons in the right doesn't need to be functional.
- The links in the left need to be functional, since is the way to navigate between the pages.

2. Footer

- The links in the right doesn't need to be functional.

3. Menu Page

- The items will be provided by the backend. You need to fetch the data from the backend and display the items in the page.

4. Detail Page

- The about section is provided by the backend.
- The button of the sizes need to be functional.
- The 'plus' and 'minus' buttons need to be functional and they need to update the price accordingly.
- The button add to cart doesn't need to be functional.

5. Context

- It is not technically necessary to implement
- However, considering the app will grow, Let's have it as needed
